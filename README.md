# Frost
Frost lets you manage your Snowflake node IDs.

## What's Snowflake?
Snowflake IDs are special 8-byte IDs generated by Twitter's 
[Snowflake](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/twitter-ids) 
[algorithm](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/a/2010/announcing-snowflake.html).

Each Snowflake ID is a 63 bit int.
- 41 bits for a timestamp (milliseconds since a custom epoch)
- 10 bits for a node id (ranging from 0 to 1023)
- 12 bits for a sequence number (ranging from 0 to 4095)

## Why Frost?
If you're planning on horizontally scaling your app, you'll need a way of managing which apps 
have which Snowflake node IDs.

More and more apps today are becoming containerized, thanks to tools like Docker.
Since containers are expected to be ephemeral, it's not enough to hard-code node IDs.

## What does Frost do?
Frost maintains two maps of app IDs. An app ID is a string and can represent anything (an int, a UUID, a hash, etc).

### The Node Map
This maps app IDs to node IDs (an int ranging from 0 to 1023).

### The Heartbeat Map
This maps app IDs to the latest heartbeat time of that app.

Apps must send heartbeats to Frost routinely, otherwise its entries are removed from both maps.

Every N seconds, Frost checks for heartbeat times older than M seconds and removes accordingly.
